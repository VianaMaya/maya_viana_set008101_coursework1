                    <h3> Fonts</h3>
                    <p>Fonts selected for this website, were in the family of arial, helvetica and san-serf, as these are fonts that are accessible on all browsers. This will allow for all users to have access to the content, especially as serif fonts are difficult to see in low-res displays..  </p>

            <h3> Style</h3>
            <p>The style of the website was retro colours with modern use of image and cards to appeal to all ages. It was intended to create balance and flow between each page, while providing clear content to explain what each page was about.</p>

                    <p>Creating a photoshop mockup after paper sketching, helps to see what the colour scheme, layout and content will look like once its coded. The colour scheme has changed a lot from the mockup but the layout and flow is still the same.</p>

                        <p>The navigation bar is kept simple as it only four pages. Would usually include toggle hamburger bar for small mobile devices. Have also include a return to top button at the bottom of the design pages as its involves scrolling, this should help user to return to the top straight away. Each page has current colour state to let user know where they are,</p>

                            <p>The typography style is classic, recognisable and clean. This was so the user was focused on enjoying the ciphers while reading some interesting facts. By displaying clear height and spacing between paragraphs and heading to keep each section easy to read.</p>
